# Business Analyst | Data Scientist | Tech Consultant

Hello everyone! I am pursuing a Master’s degree in Information Technology and Management from The University of Texas at Dallas, currently in my 2nd semester. I intend to graduate in May 2026. I completed a Bachelor’s degree in Information Science & Engineering from Ramaiah Institute of Technology, India, in May 2024. I was exposed to data analysis during my bachelor's degree, and since then, I have been fascinated by the idea of solving problems through a data-driven and analytical approach.

In my experience as a Data Engineer Intern at Hirademy Technologies, I contributed to developing a tool for analyzing medical lab reports using Gemini API keys. I helped build an Examiner Dashboard for an AI-based Examination Platform. My Python, React, and API Key extraction skills were key to these projects. I also served as an Operations Manager for a non-profit organization in India, overseeing Spoken English classes for underprivileged children lacking access to English education.
 
I love being innovative, and have a strong aptitude for problem-solving and data analysis. I'm motivated to advance my leadership skills and technical knowledge to influence IT initiatives significantly. I work best in team-oriented settings where creative, data-driven ideas are used to improve results. As my career develops, I hope to work as a Data Analyst, Business Analyst, Data Scientist, or Technical Consultant, applying my abilities to find patterns, optimize workflows, and assist in making data-driven decisions that will lead to organizational growth.

## Projects

[**Data-Driven Urban Mobility Optimization**](https://github.com/zeeshan0710/Optimizing-Urban-Mobility) | *Python, SQL, Excel, Tableau*
- In a project focused on London's extensive bike-sharing network, I engineered a robust data pipeline using Python and pandas that efficiently processed over 100,000 records of bike-sharing data. The optimized pipeline achieved a significant 40% reduction in data preparation time, streamlining the entire analysis workflow. Building upon this foundation, I crafted an interactive Tableau dashboard, complemented by custom SQL queries, that brought the city's bike-sharing dynamics to life. The dashboard visualized critical metrics across London's 800+ stations, resulting in a 35% increase in stakeholder engagement. This comprehensive solution not only enhanced data accessibility but also provided actionable insights for optimizing bike distribution throughout the network, demonstrating the tangible impact of data-driven decision making in urban mobility solutions.

[**Healthcare Analytics for Personalized Treatment**](https://github.com/zeeshan0710/Healthcare-Analytics) | *R, Machine Learning, Data Science*
- I developed a comprehensive healthcare analytics solution by implementing a data-driven framework in R that can revolutionize personalized patient care delivery. The framework achieved a 25% improvement in personalized care delivery while simultaneously boosting resource efficiency by 30%. By leveraging advanced classification techniques, including Random Forest and Logistic Regression algorithms, on a diabetes dataset, I created a robust predictive model that enhanced treatment strategy formulation. This integrated approach resulted in a significant 25% increase in patient outcome prediction accuracy, demonstrating the powerful impact of machine learning applications in healthcare decision-making processes.
